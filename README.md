# 5 Day Weather App
## week6homework

This app will allow you to search any city by name and receive information about the weather for the next five days.

It uses one AJAX get call to get general weather info and another AJAX get call to get the UV information. All of this info is added to bootstrap cards. I also wrote some logic to create images for the corresponding weather.

I also used local storage to store recent searches using a click counter function that resets after 5 clicks and then it will use that local storage data to populate a dropdown menu which is also interactive and clickable.

Felt like the functionality is entirely there now, but it is not as pretty as it could be stylistically.
